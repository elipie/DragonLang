# DragonLang

DragonLang is a language written in C, for those of you who know what PieLang is, I am taking a break from that, because I have to restart it anyways. _If you take a look at it and you know how to write languages, then you know that I did something wrong there._

Anyways, this is meant to be a challenge for me to excersise my C skills, and make something good of it. If you want to contribute, just contribute to another branch, other than the main. 

Here are some plans for it: 

1. It will be a Compiled Language

2. It will be mid-level. 
3. it will be dynamic
4. It will cover lots of things that C/Rust/C++ covers(stuff that directs right down to the hardware)
5. It will have built in Asm integration
6. And it will be pog!

When you think of dragons, you think of Strong, Powerful, Smart beings right? (or thats just me thinking of the inheritance series) 

Thats my goals of this language, to be strong, powerful, and smart.
